## My Kotlin Android App Portfolio

This repository showcases my Android development skills using Kotlin. It serves as a portfolio, containing the source code for various Android apps directly within the main directory.

**Clean and Descriptive Code:**

The Kotlin code files are named descriptively to reflect their functionality, aiding in understanding my coding style and app structure.

**Navigation:**

While folders are not used for organization, the clear and descriptive file names allow you to easily navigate and explore the code for each app.
